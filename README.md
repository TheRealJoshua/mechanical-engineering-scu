Course projects 

This repository includes source code for relatively large projects 
that are worth showcasing for anyone interested.

The subjects include Numerical Methods, Mechatronics, and Finite Element Analysis.

I've included names of collaborators in the source code for Numerical Methods and Mechatronics.
The python source code for the Finite Element Analysis program was automatically generated in Ansys Abaqus.
